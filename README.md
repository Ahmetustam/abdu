        The folder are organised basing on the scope of the files they contains and each name indicates the folder's
        scope.</p>
    <h2>Root folder</h2>
    <p>The root folder of the project contains the index.html, the main file of the website and the <b>netlify.toml</b> file, which we use to set custom headers to the Netlify host and set custom redirect URLs.</p>
    <h2>Assets</h2>
